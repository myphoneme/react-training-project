              Founded by IITians, with the objective of making technologies
              friendly to human beings. The company‚Äôs main objective is to reach

              For initial years, the main thrust is over Voice as it is the most
              widely used channel over the phone, and then over a period of
              time, these technologies will make roads even into Mobile Apps and
              embedded devices.
